# Portfolio FSND Udacity Project

A portfolio website was created based on a design mock-up (found 
[here](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf))
using a bootstrap grid system to ensure responsiveness across all screen sizes. 
Basic modal interactivity has been added to the featured work images.
1x and 2x images are included allowing the browser to choose the proper image based on device pixel ratio.
